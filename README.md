## Project Definition:


This project will present a limited scene in the form of a room with decoration and elements with wich you can interact.

The room aesthetic and theme that we will follow are movie elements and references.

There will be 9 elements with animation:

1. Thors Hammers that levitates  a little and  there is like thunders around it 
2. A light saber that extends and retracts with a color red or blue
3. A spinner like in the movie Inception that when click starts spinning for a random time making a reference like it is a dream
4. A Lightbulb that is hanging from a cable, this cable can move and will move if touched directly.
5. The Tron Bike making the blue traces
6. The robot that serves butter from Rick & Morty.
7. 
8. 
9. 

In addition to the elements with animation there might be some non-animated decorations.
