## Project Definition:


This project will present a limited scene in the form of a room with decoration and elements with wich you can interact.

The room aesthetic and theme that we will follow are movie elements and references.

There will be 9 elements with animation:

1. Thors Hammers that levitates  a little and  there is like thunders around it 
2. A light saber that extends and retracts with a color red or blue
3. A spinner like in the movie Inception that when click starts spinning for a random time making a reference like it is a dream
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. A DMC DeLorean from the movie Back to the Future, that will have functional headlights and they will project a beam of light, probablby it could open the gullwing doors.
8. Burn book from the movie Mean Girls and it would open on the exact page were Regina George trashes Cadi 
9. A figure of the TARDIS from Doctor Who. 

In addition to the elements with animation there might be some non-animated decorations.
