## Ideas

### First Idea
---

For this idea we though about a limited scenario, such as a cube or a circle.

[Complex Idea](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes)

[Lite Version with cute shaders](https://threejs-journey.xyz/)

### First Idea
---
### Third Idea
---

For these idea we can make a game like these one [Cluster Trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFPVK_XGzbg)
but instead of jumping from trucks the player must run in a city skilyne using the enviroment.  

## Technologies to use
* WebGL
* ThreeJS ?
* JavaScript 
* React/Angular ?
* HTML (is it tho?)
